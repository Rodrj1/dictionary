A website that allows you to search for words that are included in the Dictionary API. You can choose between three fonts, Arial, Courier, and Libre Baskerville(default), and light and dark mode. The website uses by default your prefered color scheme.

## Searcher

Just type a word in.

It returns, if it exist, the word with its meaning, part of speech, and phonetics (May also have an audio file to reproduce the word). Synonyms and antonyms will also be displayed should they exist for a given word.

In case it fails to fetch the data it could be the word isn't there or the API is down. Page needs to be refreshed, else searcher won't work.
